# STFoundation-vs-Classical
This repository contains code for systematic comparison of foundation models and classical feature representation methods for spatial transcriptomics analysis. We evaluate scGPT, Geneformer, Nicheformer and Novae, against classical methods such as PCA, NMF and CoCo-ST across core spatial-omics tasks, including spatial domain and niche detection, robustness to noise and resolution changes, trajectory inference and recovery of interpretable transcriptional programs.

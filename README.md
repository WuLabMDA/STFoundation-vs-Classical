# STFoundation-vs-Classical
This repository contains code for systematic comparison of foundation models and classical feature representation methods for spatial transcriptomics analysis. We evaluate scGPT, Geneformer, Nicheformer and Novae, against classical methods such as PCA, NMF and CoCo-ST across core spatial-omics tasks.
